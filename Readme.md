# Introduction
This is the project of a blender-based RPG game with my own
elaborate character life system. Script is not decided yet, so be
patient.

Plan to: Use blender to make models; use Ogre as graphics engine;
use bullet as physics engine. Use Python for core game system. 
Once tested, will use RSA to encrypt game data.
