class WeaponSystem():
    '''
    This class is the weapon system. Its main function is to 
    attack and defend, NOT storing weapons information, which
    is done by item system. What this class does is to read 
    attack of item, multiply it by attack multiplier, add to 
    base attack, and multiply by action strength multiplier.
    Same as defending.
