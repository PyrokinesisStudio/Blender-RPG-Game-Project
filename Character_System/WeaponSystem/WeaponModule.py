WeaponSystem class is the weapon system. Its main function is to 
attack and defend, NOT storing weapons information, which
is done by item system. What this class does is to read 
attack of item, multiply it by attack multiplier, add to 
base attack, and multiply by action strength multiplier.
Same as defending.
